# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive C++ learning curriculum that takes a student from basic programming concepts to advanced C++ features, system design principles, and design patterns. The curriculum will be structured as a progressive learning path with hands-on coding exercises, projects, and theoretical concepts that build upon each other.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want a structured basic fundamentals module, so that I can build a solid foundation in programming concepts and C++ syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner starts the curriculum THEN the system SHALL provide lessons covering variables, data types, operators, and basic I/O
2. WHEN the learner completes basic syntax THEN the system SHALL provide control structures (if/else, loops, switch)
3. WHEN the learner practices control structures THEN the system SHALL provide hands-on coding exercises with immediate feedback
4. WHEN the learner completes fundamentals THEN the system SHALL provide a capstone project combining all basic concepts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to master functions and modular programming, so that I can write organized and reusable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner progresses to functions THEN the system SHALL cover function declaration, definition, parameters, and return types
2. WHEN the learner understands basic functions THEN the system SHALL teach function overloading, default parameters, and recursion
3. WHEN the learner practices functions THEN the system SHALL provide exercises on scope, lifetime, and storage classes
4. WHEN the learner completes functions THEN the system SHALL introduce header files and separate compilation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to understand arrays, pointers, and memory management, so that I can work with dynamic data and understand low-level programming concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner studies arrays THEN the system SHALL cover static arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and array manipulation
2. WHEN the learner understands arrays THEN the system SHALL introduce pointers, pointer arithmetic, and pointer-array relationships
3. WHEN the learner practices pointers THEN the system SHALL teach dynamic memory allocation (new/delete) and memory management best practices
4. WHEN the learner completes memory concepts THEN the system SHALL provide debugging exercises for common memory errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to master object-oriented programming concepts, so that I can design and implement complex software systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner begins OOP THEN the system SHALL teach classes, objects, constructors, and destructors
2. WHEN the learner understands basic OOP THEN the system SHALL cover encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
3. WHEN the learner practices OOP THEN the system SHALL provide exercises on virtual functions, abstract classes, and interfaces
4. WHEN the learner completes OOP basics THEN the system SHALL introduce operator overloading and friend functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to learn advanced C++ features, so that I can write modern, efficient, and maintainable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner progresses to advanced topics THEN the system SHALL cover templates (function and class templates)
2. WHEN the learner understands templates THEN the system SHALL teach STL containers, iterators, and algorithms
3. WHEN the learner practices STL THEN the system SHALL introduce exception handling and RAII principles
4. WHEN the learner completes advanced features THEN the system SHALL cover C++11/14/17/20 modern features (auto, lambdas, smart pointers, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to understand system design principles, so that I can architect scalable and maintainable software systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner studies system design THEN the system SHALL teach UML diagrams (class, sequence, use case, activity)
2. WHEN the learner understands UML THEN the system SHALL cover SOLID principles and software architecture patterns
3. WHEN the learner practices system design THEN the system SHALL provide exercises on designing class hierarchies and system components
4. WHEN the learner completes system design THEN the system SHALL introduce performance considerations and optimization techniques

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want to master design patterns, so that I can solve common programming problems with proven solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner begins design patterns THEN the system SHALL teach creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
2. WHEN the learner understands creational patterns THEN the system SHALL cover structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
3. WHEN the learner practices structural patterns THEN the system SHALL introduce behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)
4. WHEN the learner completes design patterns THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive project implementing multiple patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want hands-on projects and practical applications, so that I can apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner completes each module THEN the system SHALL provide progressive projects that build upon previous concepts
2. WHEN the learner works on projects THEN the system SHALL offer code reviews and improvement suggestions
3. WHEN the learner encounters challenges THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guidance and problem-solving strategies
4. WHEN the learner completes the curriculum THEN the system SHALL provide a capstone project demonstrating mastery of all concepts

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a C++ learner, I want interactive learning tools and assessments, so that I can track my progress and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the learner studies concepts THEN the system SHALL provide interactive code examples and exercises
2. WHEN the learner completes exercises THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and explanations
3. WHEN the learner progresses through modules THEN the system SHALL track completion and provide progress indicators
4. WHEN the learner needs review THEN the system SHALL offer practice problems and concept reinforcement materials
