# Module 1: C++ Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand and use C++ basic data types (int, float, double, char, bool, string)
- Declare and initialize variables with proper naming conventions
- Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Understand operator precedence and associativity
- Perform basic input/output operations using cin and cout
- Apply control structures (if/else, loops, switch statements)
- Write simple programs combining all fundamental concepts
